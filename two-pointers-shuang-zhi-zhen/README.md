# Two Pointers 双指针

## 1. Algorithms

Time complexity of O\(N\)

* two-pointer\* \(most common\)
* enumaration \(find max/min from an array\)
* monotonic stack \(less than 10 questions in total\)
* monotonic queue \(very rare\)

## 2. Two Pointer Types

* face-to-face\* \(most common, e.g. is palindrome\)
  * reversed \(rare, e.g. reverse string, is palindrome\)
  * two sum \(up to 99 questions, e.g. two sum, three sum, etc.\)
  * partition \(up to 99 questions, e.g. quick sort, color sort\)
* back-to-back \( rare, longest palindrome substr, find k closest element, square of sorted array: given a sorted pos/neg element array, what's the sorted squared element array\)
* same-directional\* \(most common as well, e.g. sliding window, fast&slow pointers\)
