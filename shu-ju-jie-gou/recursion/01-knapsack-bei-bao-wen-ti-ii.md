# 0-1 Knapsack 背包问题 II

Given a set of candidate numbers (C) and a target number (T), find all unique combinations in C where the candidate numbers sums to T. \
\
All candidate numbers are unique. The same repeated number may be chosen from C unlimited number of times. Note: \
\
All numbers (including target) will be positive integers. Elements in a combination (a1, a2, … , ak) must be in non-descending order. (ie, a1 ≤ a2 ≤ … ≤ ak). \
\
The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations. \
\
Example Input: \[7], \[2, 3, 6, 7] \
\
Example Output: \[\[2, 2, 3], \[7]]
