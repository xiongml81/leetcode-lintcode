# Binary Tree and Divide & Conquer

1. **Divide & Conquer \(D & C\)**

Divide big problem into several similar and smaller problems   
****D&C vs. Binary Search

* Assime the process time is O\(1\)
* Divide & Conquer needs to process for both sides after the divide. 
* Binary Search throws away half side after the divide
* Array \(divide big array into disjoint subarrays\)
* Linked List \(not that good, need to O\(n\) to find the cutting point\)
* Binary Tree \(most natural, it has left and right sub-tree\)

Most Binary tree questions could be solved by Divide & Conquer
