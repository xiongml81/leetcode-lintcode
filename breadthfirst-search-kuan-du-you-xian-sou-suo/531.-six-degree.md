# 531. Six Degree

**BFS in implicit Graph  
需要自己找顶点，边。**

Six degrees of separation is the theory that everyone and everything is six or fewer steps away, by way of introduction, from any other person in the world, so that a chain of "a friend of a friend" statements can be made to connect any two people in a maximum of six steps.

Given a friendship relations, find the degrees of two people, return `-1` if they can not been connected by friends of friends.

```text
Input: {1,2,3#2,1,4#3,1,4#4,2,3} and s = 1, t = 4 
Output: 2
