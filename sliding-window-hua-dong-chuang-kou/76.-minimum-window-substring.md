# 76. Minimum Window Substring

[https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/)





Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return _the **minimum window substring** of _`s`_ such that every character in _`t`_ (**including duplicates**) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return the empty string _`""`_._

The testcases will be generated such that the answer is **unique**.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
Explanation: The minimum window substring "BANC" includes 'A', 'B', and 'C' from string t.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "a"
Output: "a"
Explanation: The entire string s is the minimum window.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "a", t = "aa"
Output: ""
Explanation: Both 'a's from t must be included in the window.
Since the largest window of s only has one 'a', return empty string.
```
