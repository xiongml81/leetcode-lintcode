# 106. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal

[https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-inorder-and-postorder-traversal/](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-binary-tree-from-inorder-and-postorder-traversal/)  
  
Given two integer arrays `inorder` and `postorder` where `inorder` is the inorder traversal of a binary tree and `postorder` is the postorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return _the binary tree_.  
  


```text
Input: inorder = [9,3,15,20,7], postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]
Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
```
