# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

[https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/)

Given a binary search tree \(BST\), find the lowest common ancestor \(LCA\) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants \(where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**\).”

**Example 1:**  


```text
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```
