# 235. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Search Tree

[https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/)

Given a binary search tree \(BST\), find the lowest common ancestor \(LCA\) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the [definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor): “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants \(where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**\).”

**Example 1:**  


```text
Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
```



```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */

class Solution {
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        if(root == null || p == null || q == null){
            return null;
        }
        
        int p_val = p.val;
        int q_val = q.val;
        
        if(p_val < root.val && q_val < root.val){
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q);
        }
        if(p_val > root.val && q_val > root.val){
            return lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q);
        }
        return root;
    }
}
```
