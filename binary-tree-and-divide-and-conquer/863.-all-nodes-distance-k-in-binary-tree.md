# 863. All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree

[https://leetcode.com/problems/all-nodes-distance-k-in-binary-tree/](https://leetcode.com/problems/all-nodes-distance-k-in-binary-tree/)  
  
We are given a binary tree \(with root node `root`\), a `target` node, and an integer value `k`.

Return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance `k` from the `target` node.  The answer can be returned in any order.





```text
Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], target = 5, k = 2

Output: [7,4,1]

Explanation: 
The nodes that are a distance 2 from the target node (with value 5)
have values 7, 4, and 1.
```
