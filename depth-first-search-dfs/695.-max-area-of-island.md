# 695. Max Area of Island



You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid`. An island is a group of `1`'s (representing land) connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical.) You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

The **area** of an island is the number of cells with a value `1` in the island.

Return _the maximum **area** of an island in_ `grid`. If there is no island, return `0`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,1,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0],[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The answer is not 11, because the island must be connected 4-directionally.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]]
Output: 0
```

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxAreaOfIsland(int[][] grid) {
        int res = 0;
		for(int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++){
			for(int j = 0; j < grid[i].length; j++){
				res = Math.max(isLandDSF(grid, i, j), res);
			}
		}

		return res;
    }

    public int isLandDSF(int[][] grid, int i, int j){
		if(i < grid.length && i >= 0 && j < grid[0].length && j >= 0){
			if(grid[i][j] == 0){
				return 0;
			}
			else {
				grid[i][j] = 0;
				return 1 + isLandDSF(grid, i + 1, j) + isLandDSF(grid, i - 1, j) + isLandDSF(grid, i, j + 1) + isLandDSF(grid, i, j - 1);
			}
		}
		else {
			return 0;
		}
	}

}
